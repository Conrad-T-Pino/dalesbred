== Transactions

=== Transaction callbacks

To perform a bunch of operations in transaction, use {javadocBase}org/dalesbred/transaction/TransactionCallback.html[TransactionCallback]
or {javadocBase}org/dalesbred/transaction/VoidTransactionCallback.html[VoidTransactionCallback]:

[source,java]
----
db.withTransaction(tx -> {
    // transactional operations
    ...
    return result;
});

db.withVoidTransaction(tx -> {
    // transactional operations
    ...
});
----

Optionally, you can also pass {javadocBase}org/dalesbred/transaction/Isolation.html[Isolation] or
{javadocBase}org/dalesbred/transaction/Propagation.html[Propagation] for these calls.

=== External transaction manager

If you are using https://spring.io/projects/spring-framework[Spring Framework], Dalesbred can integrate with
Spring's transaction-manager. Consult the <<_spring,Spring>>-section for details.

=== Implicit transactions

If you make calls to {javadocBase}org/dalesbred/Database.html[Database] without and explicit transaction, by default
a new transaction is started for each call. You can disallow this: in this case exceptions are thrown for calls
without an active transaction:

[source,java]
----
db.setAllowImplicitTransactions(false);
----

=== Nested transactions

Nested transactions are supported if your database supports them:

[source,java]
----
db.withTransaction(Propagation.NESTED, tx -> {
    ...
});
----
